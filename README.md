# ðŸ“Š Investment Tracker â€“ Unified Portfolio Dashboard

## ðŸš€ Overview

**Investment Tracker** is a personal finance tool that connects to multiple brokers like Zerodha, Groww, and AngelOne to give users a consolidated view of their investments and trades. 

It aims to solve the problem of fragmented financial tracking by offering a unified dashboard for:
- Stock holdings
- Mutual funds
- F&O trades
- Capital gains and tax reporting

The project is designed for investors and traders who want full visibility and control over their portfolio across platforms â€” all in one place.
